1. Check dataloader structure
    - Intrapolation
    - Extrapolation
    * ODE-RNN has to be trained in intrapolation dataset, but should be tested on extrapolation dataset.

2. Check plotting method
    - Is it actually plotting extrapolation?
    - If so, what would change if ODE-RNN was used

3. Change method
    - Training: use predicted value as an input for 50% of the time.
    - Testing: use initial half to encode and predict the latter half (this is similar to that of what I've done in the past)

4. Mask
    - How is it being used?
